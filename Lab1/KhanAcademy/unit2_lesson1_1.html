<h1>No man is an island</h1>
<p>No man is an island,<br>
  Entire of itself,<br>
  Every man is a piece of the continent,<br>
  A part of the main.<br>
  If a clod be washed away by the sea,<br>
  Europe is the less.<br>
  As well as if a promontory were.<br>
  As well as if a manor of thy friend’s<br>
  Or of thine own were:<br>
  Any man’s death diminishes me,<br>
  Because I am involved in mankind,<br>
  And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;<br>
  It tolls for thee.<br>
